**General info**

This is my first project. It is a simple, non-responsive website for *Zdalnie maturalnie*, my friend's future online teaching company.

**Inspiration**
I was given very general instructions of what the site is supposed to look like. 


**Technologies**
The website is build in React, I also used jQuery and SASS.

**Status**
Currently hiatus, waiting for more info from the client.
